# Students Transcripts Generator

Developed a web app where students can get their academic transcripts by uploading their subject-wise grades in each semester.

Implemented the code of designing the transcript pdf using **fpdf** library in **Python** and then created a GUI using **Streamlit** for better access of functionalities.

The code is dynamic enough to incorporate new branches, additional courses and semesters and it even automatically adjusts the layout of pdf according to different programmes eg. B.Tech, M.Tech, PhD.
